[AI and the Art of Fragrance: Algorithmic Perfumery by ScenTronix ~ Interviews](https://www.fragrantica.com/news/AI-and-the-Art-of-Fragrance-Algorithmic-Perfumery-by-ScenTronix-18685.html) 

 In recent times the topic of AI _(ed.: Artificial Intelligence)_ has been constantly on my radar, so I pay attention to projects at the intersection of new technologies and perfumery art. Almost always, interviews come about by chance through fate, and so it happened this time: a friend of mine visiting the **Museum of the Future** in Dubai noticed an unusual perfume machine and sent me the photo. Of course, I was interested and decided to look into it and find the founders of the project. That's how I ended up on the project's website dedicated to the AI tech start-up **“ScenTronix”**, **“Algorithmic Perfumery”** machines and on-line bespoke [perfume service “EveryHuman.”](https://www.everyhuman.com/us)  
> 最近，人工智能（AI）的话题一直在我的关注范围内，因此我关注新技术和香水艺术交叉的项目。几乎总是通过缘分偶然得到采访机会，这次也是这样：我的一位朋友在迪拜未来博物馆参观时注意到了一台不寻常的香水机器，并给我发了照片。当然，我很感兴趣，决定调查一下并找到该项目的创始人。这就是我进入了该项目网站，该网站专门介绍 AI 技术初创公司 “ScenTronix”、“算法香水” 机器和在线定制香水服务“EveryHuman”。

To figure out how AI tech start-up **“ScenTronix”** works and to understand how the company automatically creates customized fragrances, I decided to ask a few questions of their co-founder and scent designer, **Anahita Mekanik**.  
为了了解人工智能科技初创公司 “ScenTronix” 的工作原理，并理解该公司如何自动创建定制香气，我决定向他们的联合创始人和香气设计师 Anahita Mekanik 提出一些问题。

**DARIIA:** Anahita, tell us a little bit more about your projects. When and how the company was founded, where it all began?   
DARIIA：Anahita，请告诉我们更多关于你的项目的信息。公司是何时以及如何成立的？一切都是从哪里开始的？

**ANAHITA:** Frederik Duerinck and I met in New York in 2016. He was part of the Dutch collective Polymorf at the time, and I was head of marketing North America back then at International Flavors & Fragrances, Inc. We were working on a future-sketching initiative called "Avant-Garden" and invited Frederik to join the project. He envisioned the concept of generative scent design during a work session along with a machine that he sketched on the spot…That was the genesis! Fast forward to 2018 and the leap of faith to develop that first inquiry to its full potential. **"ScenTronix"** was founded in June of 2018 with its unique position at the crossroads of art, science and technology, with the vision to empower people through their senses. Since then, we have showcased our scent creation experience, **"Algorithmic Perfumery"** TM which is powered by "ScenTronix" technology in exhibitions around the world. The **“EveryHuman"** TM label under which the Algorithmic Perfumery experience is offered to a broader audience was revealed in 2020.  
ANAHITA：Frederik Duerinck 和我在 2016 年在纽约相遇。当时他是荷兰集体 Polymorf 的一员，而我则是国际香料和香精公司北美市场营销负责人。我们正在进行一个名为 “Avant-Garden” 的未来构想计划，并邀请 Frederik 加入该项目。他在一次工作会议上构思了生成香气设计的概念，并当场草拟了一台机器... 这就是起源！快进到 2018 年，我们决定大胆尝试，将第一个探究发展到极致。 "ScenTronix" 成立于 2018 年 6 月，其独特的位置处于艺术、科学和技术的交汇处，旨在通过人们的感官赋予他们力量。从那时起，我们展示了由 “ScenTronix” 技术驱动的香气创作体验“Algorithmic Perfumery”TM，在世界各地的展览中展示。 "EveryHuman"TM 标签是在 2020 年推出的，旨在向更广泛的受众提供 Algorithmic Perfumery 体验。

**DARIIA:** Who is the creator of the AI platform and **“Algorithmic Perfumery”** machines?   
DARIIA：人工智能平台和 “算法香水” 机器的创造者是谁？

**ANAHITA:** Frederik is the inventor and master architect of the machine and platform.   
ANAHITA：Frederik 是这台机器和平台的发明者和主要架构师。

**DARIIA:** Can you share some specifics about how your AI platform works and how it was trained?  
DARIIA：您能分享一些关于您的 AI 平台如何工作以及如何进行训练的具体细节吗？

![](https://fimgs.net/himg/o.8QCfDF2SoIU.jpg)

**ANAHITA:** The system uses reinforced machine learning. There are different algorithms that look at different parts of the overall answers provided by a user. One system looks at psychological answers, another at all answers given, and a third one at various clusters of questions and "how" the user answered (for example did the user go back and forth). The AI-system then creates three unique scents based on this input. After smelling their scent creations, we ask for very simple feedback on how the system performed. This feedback trains the system on its performance. Over 75K users have interacted with the platform so far. 

**DARIIA:** How do the machines work? Do you use raw ingredients or ready-made accords? Is the number of unique combinations limited in any way?

![](https://fimgs.net/himg/o.fwxSCUP0M9a.jpg)

**ANAHITA:** The palette for the mid-size machine is composed of 46 building blocks / accords. We have left 2 spots empty for new inspirations! Each is a mini composition that spans across a wide range of sensory worlds. A building block may contain anywhere from 2 to 20 single raw materials depending on the level of complexity of the olfactory profile. We’ve put a lot of care and effort towards curating a palette of ingredients that gives our users access to the most beautiful and highest quality materials available in the industry to allow a myriad of sensations and creations (over 500 billion possibilities!). We’ve chosen our ingredients based on their intrinsic beauty and hedonic qualities, not whether they are synthetic or natural. We believe every ingredient has a role to play in a formula. We use a selection of LMR Naturals —undoubtedly the most stunning qualities available — as well as contemporary synthetic molecules which are the signature of modern perfumery. We are deeply committed to transparency and safety in the creative process. To that purpose, we have created a toxicology review function that is integrated in our platform that checks creations against international safety guidelines. We are very proud to make this professional perfumery feature available at an individual level for the very first time. 

![](https://fimgs.net/himg/o.Wiorn7BbtxS.jpg)

**DARIIA:** Wow, LMR Naturals by IFF are truly amazing! Does it mean IFF is raw material partner of your project?

**ANAHITA:** Yes! We are proud to have the support of IFF, who is our ingredients partner.

**DARIIA:** That’s wonderful! Also about “Algorithmic Perfumery” machines, for instance let’s talk about your machine at Museum of the Future in Dubai. How fast are fragrances created on it? Does it work fully unstaffed or...?

![](https://fimgs.net/himg/o.gBP4LWesOad.jpg)

**ANAHITA:** The machine does need help from staff to get the bottles off the production belt and into a box. You can look at it as a collaboration between human and machine :). Our machine in residency at Museum of the Future in Dubai allows visitors from all over the world to participate in the creation of their scents on-site. All scents are produced in real-time and saved under the user’s profile so they can be easily re-ordered. The sensory machine can produce scents for 50 visitors per hour. 

![](https://fimgs.net/himg/o.SZMrWjWVtdk.jpg)

**DARIIA:** Impressive performance! What other features does your platform have?

**AHAHITA:** One game-changing feature our platform offers is the "tweak" function, which allows users to autonomously create variations of their scents. They are able to change the ratio of a building block or add new one(s) to their taste. We also offer on-line sessions with a scent coach to guide them through this process. It offers the unique opportunity to go deeper into the creative process and truly engage and learn about ingredients. We believe every human is a creator and view our platform and technology as an enabler for anyone to explore their intuition using the medium of scent. 

**DARIIA:** It seems many perfume enthusiasts would be interested in trying this experience…

![](https://fimgs.net/himg/o.HaOVSge0Ebi.jpg)

**ANAHITA:**I get so much joy out of seeing people step into their creative power and have fun alone or together. I’ve also had very profound moments witnessing people either moved to tears or ecstatic because they smelled something that made them feel fully seen. It is in such moments that all the sweat and tears, and ups and downs it takes to build such a platform keeps us going. There was no blueprint for what we have created. We set our own roadmap, which we’ve been executing on for the past 5 years to arrive to this point. It has taken our team of 15 people many trials and errors and a good dose of stubbornness to build everything (firmware, hardware, software, ingredient building blocks). We do everything in-house…and there is so much more to come! 

My hope for perfume enthusiasts who try the experience is that they take full advantage of the innovation our platform offers to dive deep into the creative process. I suspect they’ll have a blast tweaking their formulae and great instincts to create unexpected scents to share with the world!

Inspired by the enthusiastic charge from Anahita, I decided to continue my exploration and test the AI platform at least online, since I'm so far away from **“Algorithmic Perfumery”** machines nowadays.  

When you start creating a bespoke fragrance [on the EveryHuman website](https://www.everyhuman.com/us/products), you are taken to a questionnaire with 27 consecutive questions.

![](https://fimgs.net/himg/o.e6Dei9Eip1e.jpg)

As Anahita said, there are some psychological questions, for instance about your roles in life and self-description.

![](https://fimgs.net/himg/o.6qWU1WY2Rmk.jpg)

There are also some queries at the junction of crossmodal perception and synesthesia _(ed.: synesthesia is a perceptual phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway)._  

![](https://fimgs.net/himg/o.k7wcGIw5vQI.jpg)
_The kiki/bouba effect is a common example of non-arbitrary mental association between certain speech sounds and certain visual shapes. _  

Also, of course, there are segments to clarify personal olfactory preferences.

![](https://fimgs.net/himg/o.NqJAVNjP0Uy.jpg)

It was interesting to test the system and find out what topics creators consider as important to identify possible preferences.

![](https://fimgs.net/himg/o.HFUOXs4zwyQ.jpg)

At the end of the questionnaire, I smiled at finding my reason for being there; the creators had provided for that, too! :)

The survey took me to a page with three formula options (made up of acсord percentages) that could be revealed, viewed, and ordered as perfumes.

![](https://fimgs.net/himg/o.9PU1rB7ZMyx.jpg)

I can’t say anything about my final results because I have no possibility to try them, but for sure it was an entertaining experience.

![](https://fimgs.net/himg/o.ZCkK3JM7S2I.jpg)

Therefore, I would like to thank Anahita for the interview and to wish the project new technical heights. To the readers: exciting adventures await in the world of **“Algorithmic Perfumery”**!
