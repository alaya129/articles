> A French perfume industry executive said to me “In perfumery in France, everyone comes from the sixteenth arrondissement, they’re all raised with Hermès scarves, they all have degrees in poetry and commerce from some chic school, and they all think life is actually like this. They consider that what they create is great art and that because they are French the world should come on bended knee and consider itself lucky to be blessed with their creations. You talk to a French perfume executive, and it’s ‘I worked for Chanel, for Dior, for L’Oréal, I launched this and that perfume, and my perfumes are wonderful, fabulous, they lost five million dollars, but who cares, they’re objects of art that will live forever and conform to my immortal, pure aesthetic.’
>
> In America people in perfumery are interested in money, money, and then money. It’s ‘I did this perfume, and in the first year it did X million and the second year it did Y million, and the third year it did Z million, and here’s my title and here’s my bonus.’ If you ask them about the beauty of their perfumes, they say, ‘What do you mean, “beauty of my perfumes?"

One of the key characteristics of perfumery is that it sits at the intersection of art and science. Today, it can only exist as a superposition of these two activities. Naturally, it is primarily a form of creativity and self-expression: we love fragrances for the vivid emotions they offer us. At the same time, customers are often very demanding about the technical qualities of a composition, with longevity being among the first things they're interested in.

By "longevity" and "projection", a whole range of different physical properties and technical qualities are often implied. They are frequently confused with one another, and such nuances lead to a lot of debate because different people perceive the same fragrance differently even on a "technical" level.

Naturally, scent perception is very individual. When it comes to the "beauty of perfumes", everything boils down to the cliché that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder", and that it's impossible to measure"beauty"in some"units of beauty"or compare apples to oranges. Although such parameters do exist and discussing aesthetic qualities is possible and necessary (primarily, on Fragrantica, that's what we focus on), we'll leave this complex matter for later.

Nevertheless, there are many fragrance parameters that can be measured, compared, and even theoretically calculated. Let's discuss that today.

**The odor detection threshold** is the lowest concentration at which an aromatic compound can be detected by its smell.

**The odor recognition threshold**, which is always higher than the detection threshold, is the concentration at which an odorous substance can not only be detected but also identified (i.e. named): we understand that it's not just a random smell, but we can precisely identify what it is.

The odor detection and recognition thresholds of a fragrant substance are often viewed as the molecular properties of that substance. However, they are subjective: they can only truly be determined experimentally. They can be represented only as relating to an individual or as an average value across a group: usually, if a large number of individual threshold values are plotted on a graph showing the number of people with that threshold value, the result is a classic [Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution).

![](https://fimgs.net/himg/o.PDRC4ZvGcoX.jpg)

Interestingly, odor detection thresholds are lower when the left nostril is more closed. This special effect might be an inheritance from creatures with stereoscopic "3D" olfaction (e.g. moles and sharks) that allows them to determine the distance to the odor source.

At the same time, there are numerous attempts at theoretically calculating threshold values using only the physicochemical properties of molecules, with **volatility** and **hydrophobicity** being the most important.

It's evident that volatility plays a significant role in the physical delivery of an odorant to the nose and subsequently to the receptor, while hydrophobicity is a crucial factor affecting the binding strength of the fragrant molecule to the receptor. This partly explains why the character of the smell (olfactory profile) and the intensity of the smell are independent parameters.

Volatility is also quite quantifiable since it directly depends on equilibrium [vapor pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_pressure). [Jean Carles](https://www.fragrantica.com/noses/Jean_Carles.html) once mentioned that the finest and most harmonious accords are obtained from substances with comparable values of saturated vapor pressure and, therefore, similar volatility. Due to this fact it's extremely challenging to work with fragrant substances possessing radical values of this parameter: finding suitable companions for them isn't easy.

A certain alternative to olfactory thresholds is the so-called **probability of detection**. It's measured this way: subjects are presented with various random concentrations of a fragrant substance and blank samples without the fragrant substance. They're then asked to indicate whether they can smell it or not. Each concentration is presented multiple times, and the likelihood that the subject will give the correct answer can be plotted against the concentration. Interestingly, these curves have a [sigmoidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) shape, and the slope for different substances can be vastly different. The concentration range wherein the detection probability transitions from predictability 0 to 1 (i.e., always accurate) ranges between one to five orders of magnitude. In other words, the concentration range in which people might detect (or conversely, not detect) the smell of, say, butyric acid, varies only tenfold, while for something like ethyl caproate, it varies by a whopping 100,000 times.

The collective technical qualities of a fragrance in English are typically called "**performance**."In this context, it signifies effectiveness, efficiency, and technicality. The question of whether the"performance"of a perfume composition depends solely on the"efficiency" of its individual components remains controversial. However, strictly speaking, understanding the interrelationship of components and mastering the art of composition contribute significantly to the technical qualities of the final fragrance.

Several technical parameters are determined immediately after applying a fragrance. The so-called "**impact**"refers to the force of the fragrance's impression in the initial moments of encountering it: when smelling the bottle, blotter, or immediately upon applying the product to the skin. "**Diffusion**", which is closest to the concept of"**sillage**", measures the distance at which a fragrance becomes noticeable shortly after application.

Physics of diffusion in mixtures is well-understood, described by several well-known equations like _Raoult's laws_ (they refer to quantitative relationships describing certain properties of solutions that depend on concentration but not on the nature of the dissolved substance) or _Fick's laws of diffusion_ (they can be used to solve for the diffusion coefficient). For a volatile substance to spread around, air movement is necessary (as we understand, all atoms around are in constant thermal motion, but the more intense the convection, the more efficiently the substance will disperse). The volatility and **scent intensity** of a fragrant substance primarily affect how strongly we feel its smell at a distance.

Scent intensity is often confused with "detectability" (detection threshold), and threshold values are sometimes used to compare intensities. This isn't entirely accurate because the threshold and intensity are different and unrelated phenomena. As with the threshold, intensity is very subjective and varies from person to person.

For one person, we can easily measure the threshold value by presenting increasingly higher concentrations until the test subject can precisely identify whether they sense the smell. However, measuring intensity at concentrations exceeding the threshold isn't as straightforward. In the case of light or sound, we can physically measure their quantity, but in the case of scent, we must rely on someone's subjective judgment about whether one sample smells stronger than another and, if so, the ratio of their intensities.

![](https://fimgs.net/himg/o.2x3zJW8PLss.jpg)

As I mentioned earlier, the relationship between the concentration of a substance and the perceived intensity of its smell, especially in the case of "super potent" compounds, is very shallow. If we can clearly detect the smell of a 0.01% solution of a fragrant substance (many of which are known), it doesn't mean that the smell of the pure substance will seem 10,000 times stronger to us. The sensitivity of all our sensory organs changes at least logarithmically.

The graph showing the dependency between concentration and intensity can vary in appearance and slope, and sometimes these graphs can even intersect. For example, at a concentration in the air of 312.5ppm (parts per million), the odors of dimethyl trisulfide and methional seem equally intense. Still, at a concentration of 0.5 ppm, the intensity of the methional smell seems significantly higher than that of dimethyl trisulfide. This is why the concentration (the percentage of the fragrant composition introduced into the product) is always strictly fixed, and there's no point in increasing it: it cannot make the smell more intense or persistent, but it can easily disrupt the composition balance.

By the way, the infamous **tenacity** (longevity/longlastingness) of a scent is the duration for which the scent remains perceptible after being applied to a surface. Tenacity depends on the vapor pressure of the substance or mixture of substances: obviously, more volatile substances will evaporate from the surface faster than less volatile ones. The affinity of a compound to the surface to which it is applied also affects its persistence (this strongly depends, for example, on hydrophobicity and surface activity). Persistence on the skin, on a tester strip, or on gauze, as in state standard tests, will vary. Tenacity of a multi-component fragrance mainly depends on the tenacity of the individual components that make it up.

What is referred to as "**volume**" in English literature, in terms of fragrance, is the effect at a distance, some time after application. The difference between tenacity and volume often underlies misunderstandings. Industry professionals, for instance, are used to evaluating fragrances up close: they assess tenacity, while consumers are more likely to judge the volume.

There is also **odor volume** of a particular material, here what is typically meant is somewhat different. At first glance, it seems like its intensity, but there's a distinction. If we apply undiluted benzyl acetate and α-ionone to tester strips, the benzyl acetate appears stronger to us. However, when using these two substances in perfume compositions, low levels of α-ionone usually produce a much greater effect than the same levels of benzyl acetate. Benzyl acetate loses its potency faster when diluted than α-ionone does; it has a lower intensity of scent.

There's also another specific parameter referred to as"**bloom**"or"blooming". This term is usually used for various foaming products such as soaps, shower gels, and shampoos. Blooming refers to the ability of a perfume composition to disperse in volume when a cleaning agent comes into contact with water. When you enter a bathroom and sense the scent of a gel or shampoo someone recently used – that's blooming. Sometimes, this effect is also attributed to "fine" fragrances, denoting a fragrance's ability to"linger"in the air. Metaphorically speaking, when you enter an elevator and distinctly perceive the lavish Baccarat fragrance of a neighbor who was there a few minutes ago, it's more of blooming than a sillage.

![](https://fimgs.net/himg/o.5T2ksJtxw00.jpg)

Another similar term is "**radiance**". This term is used when, for instance, a piece of soap or an unlit candle diffuses its fragrance around. If sillage is the"trail"left by a perfumed person passing by you, then"radiance" refers to the diffusion from a stationary object.

This parameter can be measured by leaving a source of fragrance (e.g. a blotter) in a draft-free room for a period of time. Afterward, once the aromatic substances have diffused, you can approach the source, attempting to pinpoint the distance at which the fragrance becomes noticeable. The spread of this radiance can indicate how pervasive or enveloping a fragrance is even when stationary.

All the listed characteristics of fragrant substances and their mixtures (perfume compositions) are purely physical properties of the material. Many of them are not related to each other, and even more so, all this is in no way related to the 'quality' (whatever that might mean) or 'naturalness' of the odorant's origin.
